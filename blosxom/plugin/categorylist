=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plugin: categorylist

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: Grants $categorylist::display, a list of all category directories with
appropriate links for the blog sidebar.

=head1 VERSION

0.2.5 Added Rick Crawford's page count patch.
=head1 AUTHOR

Keith Hudgins <greenman@greenman.org> http://www.greenman.org

=head1 BUGS

I don't know of any.

=head1 USAGE

Just drop this into your blosxom plugins directory. Then, you can insert the 
variable:

$categorylist::display

into your flavour files wherever you want a list of your categories to go. Each
line holds the name of one category, each one linked to the appropriate place in
your blosxom weblog.

If you want the directory path slashes removed, just look at the config
variables. Set $iDontWantSlashes equal to 1, and change $replacement's
assignment to whatever you want the non-leading slashes to be equal to.

To print an unordered list instead of a series of break-tag separated links, set $giveMeAList to 1.It'll print a standard <ul> list, xhtml-compliant. If you want it to look differently, use your stylesheets to alter its appearance. http://www.alistapart.com/articles/taminglists is a great reference on how to do this.

Finally, I've added a requested feature: you can exclude any directory by putting a file named "category.exclude" (no quotes) into that directory. This does NOT affect subdirectories. If you want to exclude a whole subdirectory, put the category.exclude file in each one.

Wow, I'm gettin' all sophisticated and stuff. :)

NEW: Rick Crawford senf me a patch which I've added in. You can now have your categorylist display article counts in your menu. Just flip the bit (byte technically, I know) on the $iWantArticleCounts flag in the config up top.
